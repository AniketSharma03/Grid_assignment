Sol:Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as a row or a column.It is ideal for laying out items along a single axis.

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns.It provides a grid container where items can be placed in cells, and the layout can be controlled in both directions.

3.How can you define rows and columns for your grid?

Example:
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
}
